## Jump 1 or 2 steps, [Climbing Stairs](../climbing-stairs)

"12", it could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12). 

It is just like jumping 1 step A B or 2 steps 12. 

But, there are some restrictions. 

e.g.

"31" can only decode as "C" (3) and "A" (1)

So, what we need to do is to add something to the `Climbing Stairs`, do not climb the invalid stairs.
