I learnt `Finite-State Automaton` many years ago. This problem is a good chance for me to make one myself.
Maybe there are many other ways to solve this problem since it is a simple regex matching. 
However, this problem helps me understand `Finite-State Automaton` better.

Code shoud do as following


 1. Build a [NFA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton_with_%CE%B5-moves) using pattern
 1. Convert to [DFA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton)
 1. Let string walk in the DFA to see if it matches the pattern
