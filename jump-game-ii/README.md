## [Prim's algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim's_algorithm)

This solution looks like [Prim's algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim's_algorithm).


 * jump to the furthest reachable point
 * update `maxjump` like [Jump Game](../jump-game)
 * `count = count + 1`
 * loop until reach the end
