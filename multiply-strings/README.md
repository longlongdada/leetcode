## Final Boss

After [Add Two Numbers](../add-two-numbers), [Add Binary](../add-binary) and [Plus One](../plus-one), here comes the final Boss. :-0


### Multiply and Transfer Carry

 * create a `(m + n) array` as a paper: `m` digits * `n` digits resluts at most a `m + n` digits number. Think 99 * 99.
 * each two digit multiply and save the onto the paper
 * transfer the carry like [Add Two Numbers](../add-two-numbers)
